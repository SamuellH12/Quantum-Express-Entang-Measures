# Quantum-Expressibility-and-Entangling-Measures

Scientific Initiation project to implement Expressibility and Entangling metrics based on
[Expressibility and entangling capability of parameterized quantum circuits for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, arXiv:1905.10876](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10876) 

Also implement a way to descript quantum circuits in a file and get they as Qiskit or Pennylane circuits


## Focus features:
- Measure KL Divergence of a Qiskit Quantum circuit (Kullback-leibler Divergence)


## Extra features:
- Get Qiskit Circuit from description file
- Get Pennylane Circuit from description file
